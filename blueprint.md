# **MBTI Personality Test Application**

## **Overview**

This application is an interactive MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) personality test designed to help users discover their personality type. The user answers a series of questions, and the application calculates and displays their MBTI type along with a description.

## **Current Plan**

1.  **Implement Internationalization:**
    *   Set the default language to Korean.
    *   Add a language switcher to allow users to toggle between Korean and English.
    *   Store all text content in a separate `translations.js` file.
2.  **Update JavaScript to handle language switching and display translated content.**
3.  **Configure a development server to run the web application.**
